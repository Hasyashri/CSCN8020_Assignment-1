##  Overview

This project contains the solutions to the 4 main problems based on Reinforcement Learning concepts including:

1. Designing an MDP for a pick-and-place robot
2. Value Iteration on a 2x2 Gridworld
3. Value Iteration (Classic and In-Place) on a 5x5 Gridworld
4. Off-Policy Monte Carlo method with Importance Sampling

Each part contains:
- Simple explanations
- Full working Python code
- Value function and policy outputs

## Problems Breakdown

###  Problem 1: Pick-and-Place Robot
- Defined a Markov Decision Process (MDP) for a robotic arm.
- Included state space, actions, and reward function.
- Goal: Teach the robot to perform fast and smooth pick-and-place operations.

###  Problem 2: 2x2 Gridworld – Value Iteration
- Performed 2 iterations of value iteration manually.
- Updated value function and evaluated policy.

###  Problem 3: 5x5 Gridworld – Value Iteration
- Classic Value Iteration (copy of value array)
- In-Place Value Iteration (updates immediately)
- Compared speed, memory usage, and accuracy.

###  Problem 4: Monte Carlo with Importance Sampling
- Used a random behavior policy to generate episodes.
- Updated state values using off-policy learning.
- Compared Monte Carlo with Value Iteration.
